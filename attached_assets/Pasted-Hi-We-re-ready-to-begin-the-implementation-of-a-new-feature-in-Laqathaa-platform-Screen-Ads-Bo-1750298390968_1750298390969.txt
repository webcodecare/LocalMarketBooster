Hi,

We‚Äôre ready to begin the implementation of a new feature in Laqathaa platform:
üì∫ Screen Ads Booking System ‚Äî for merchants to display ads in physical screens located inside caf√©s, restaurants, and malls.

Please follow the full breakdown below and start Phase 1:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 1: Screen Locations & Map Interface
	1.	Database Structure
Create a new table: screen_locations with:

	‚Ä¢	id
	‚Ä¢	name (e.g. Caf√© Boulevard)
	‚Ä¢	latitude
	‚Ä¢	longitude
	‚Ä¢	address (city, area, street)
	‚Ä¢	working_hours
	‚Ä¢	screen_count
	‚Ä¢	is_active

Optional: Add a column for screen type (TV / Tablet / LED Wall)
	2.	Admin Interface to Manage Locations

	‚Ä¢	Add/Edit/Delete screen locations via dashboard

	3.	User Map Interface

	‚Ä¢	On the merchant dashboard, add a new tab: ‚ÄúAdvertise on Screens‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Show a Google Map with markers for all available locations
	‚Ä¢	On marker click: show popup with:
	‚Ä¢	Place name
	‚Ä¢	Number of screens
	‚Ä¢	Working hours
	‚Ä¢	Button: ‚ÄúBook Ad Here‚Äù

	4.	Google Maps Integration
Use Google Maps API to display all locations on the map with real-time zoom and marker interaction.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 2: Booking Flow & Content Upload
	1.	Booking Page After Click

	‚Ä¢	Merchant selects:
	‚Ä¢	Start date
	‚Ä¢	Duration (e.g. 3 days, 1 week)
	‚Ä¢	Uploads image or video (MP4, JPG, PNG)
	‚Ä¢	System calculates total cost:
	‚Ä¢	(duration in days √ó fixed daily rate per screen)
	‚Ä¢	Example: 3 days √ó 2 screens √ó 50 SAR = 300 SAR

	2.	Confirmation Page

	‚Ä¢	Show booking summary
	‚Ä¢	Button: ‚ÄúSubmit for Review‚Äù

	3.	Admin Approval Flow

	‚Ä¢	In admin panel, you see:
	‚Ä¢	Uploaded content
	‚Ä¢	Location booked
	‚Ä¢	Merchant info
	‚Ä¢	Option to approve/reject + schedule display time manually or automatically

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Phase 3: Display & Schedule Logic (Basic MVP)
	1.	Basic Schedule Table (screen_ads)

	‚Ä¢	id, merchant_id, location_id, media_url, start_date, end_date, status

	2.	Manual Playback (MVP)

	‚Ä¢	Each screen can access approved media via a public endpoint or downloadable link (e.g. Google Drive, Firebase Storage)

	3.	Future Enhancements (Not now)

	‚Ä¢	Dynamic playlist generation
	‚Ä¢	Raspberry Pi / Android app for automatic screen playback
	‚Ä¢	Performance analytics: # of displays, estimated views

‚∏ª

Let me know when Phase 1 (Map + Locations) is complete so I can review and approve.

We‚Äôll build this as a fully integrated feature inside the Laqathaa ecosystem, with full control from the admin side (no accounts for the restaurants).

Thanks!
