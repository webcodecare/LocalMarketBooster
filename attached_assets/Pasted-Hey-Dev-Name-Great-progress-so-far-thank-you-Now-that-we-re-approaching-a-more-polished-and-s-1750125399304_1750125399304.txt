Hey [Dev Name],

Great progress so far ‚Äî thank you! Now that we‚Äôre approaching a more polished and scalable version of the admin dashboard, we need to improve the subscription system significantly to make it production-ready.

Below are the required enhancements for the **Subscription Plan Feature Management** module:

---

## ‚úÖ Objective:
Transform the subscription system into a **fully dynamic, feature-based plan manager**, where each plan (Free / Basic / Premium / etc.) can have a custom set of features controlled from the admin dashboard.

---

## üì¶ Admin Capabilities Required:

1. Create and manage multiple subscription plans (add/edit/delete).
2. Create and manage features (add/edit/delete).
3. For each plan, toggle each feature as:
   - ‚úÖ Included
   - ‚ùå Not included
4. Display a clear **comparison matrix/table** of plans and features (like SaaS platforms such as Notion, Trello, etc.).
5. All plan data and features must be stored in the database, not hardcoded.

## üß† Feature List (Seed Suggestions to Implement Now):

Please start by implementing the following features as default options in the system:

| Feature                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| AI Offer Analyzer                   | Analyzes offers using AI for improvements |
| Auto Repost System                  | Automatically reposts offers to keep them fresh |
| Advanced Offer Analytics            | See views, clicks, and engagement |
| Offer Highlighting                  | Visually highlight offers in listings |
| Early Access to New Features        | Access beta features before others |
| Priority Support                    | Fast-track technical support |
| Campaign Scheduler                  | Schedule offers for specific dates |
| Multi-Branch Access                 | Allow access to manage multiple branches |
| Verified Business Badge             | Special badge next to merchant name |
| Custom Offer Themes                 | Allow merchants to apply custom design styles |
| Manual Offer Approval Bypass       | Publish offers instantly without admin review |

Feel free to adjust names or icons as needed ‚Äî but these features must be dynamically manageable.

## üß© Additional Notes:

- The merchant interface should display this table in a clean, responsive format so merchants can easily compare what they get per plan.
- You can use checkmarks (‚úÖ) and crosses (‚ùå), or a toggle system to show inclusion.
- Consider modularity ‚Äî this system may expand later with enterprise-level features.

Let me know once this structure is in place or if you'd like me to provide an API schema / DB design suggestion to help with implementation.

Thanks again!
