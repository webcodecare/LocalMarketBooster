Here are a few additional UI/UX and CMS updates I need on the Baraq platform:

------------------------------------
🔒 [1] Hide Screen Ads Publicly (continued)
------------------------------------
In addition to hiding the "Screen Ads" module from merchants, please also:

- Hide the following links from the homepage and footer for non-admin users:
   - “تصفح مواقع الشاشات” button
   - Footer links under “الخدمات” like “الشاشات الإعلانية” and “حجز الشاشات”

- Ensure these pages do not appear in the frontend navigation, and only Admins can access them directly by URL.

------------------------------------
⚙️ [2] Dynamic Static Page Management (CMS)
------------------------------------
- I need a simple interface in the Admin Panel to manage **static content pages**, such as:
   - من نحن
   - سياسة الخصوصية
   - الشروط والأحكام
   - الدعم الفني

Features required:
- Create / Edit / Delete pages
- Page title (English + Arabic)
- URL slug (auto-generated or editable)
- Rich Text Editor (e.g., TinyMCE / QuillJS)
- Visibility toggle (on/off)

These pages should be reflected dynamically in the website’s top and footer menus based on visibility.

------------------------------------
📱 [3] Social Media Icons in Footer
------------------------------------
- Please add icons for the following social platforms in the website footer:
   - Instagram
   - X (Twitter)
   - LinkedIn
   - Snapchat
   - TikTok
- Admin should be able to update the URLs from the Admin Panel → Settings.

------------------------------------
💬 [4] Floating WhatsApp Button
------------------------------------
- Add a floating WhatsApp button on the homepage (and optionally across all pages).
- It should appear either **bottom-left or bottom-right**, with an option to control placement.
- Admin should be able to:
   - Set the WhatsApp number
   - Choose position (left/right)
   - Enable/disable the floating button

Example UX: A WhatsApp icon that opens a new tab to `https://wa.me/966xxxxxxxxx` when clicked.

Let me know if you need mockups or sample admin UI for the CMS section.
