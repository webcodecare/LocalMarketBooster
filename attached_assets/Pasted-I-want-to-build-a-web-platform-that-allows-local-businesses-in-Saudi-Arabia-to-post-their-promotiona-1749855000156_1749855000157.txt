I want to build a web platform that allows local businesses in Saudi Arabia to post their promotional offers and discounts. The platform will be organized into multiple categories such as Restaurants, Travel & Tourism, Cafes, Clinics, Online Stores, and more.

The concept is to allow companies to register on the platform, create their own business profile, and post offers such as limited-time discounts, coupon codes, or seasonal deals. Visitors can browse all the offers easily without logging in.

👥 User Roles:

1. Visitor (User):
   - Can browse offers by category or location.
   - No login required.

2. Business (Advertiser):
   - Can register and create a business account.
   - Can add/edit/delete their own offers.
   - Each offer includes: title, image(s), description, link (e.g., WhatsApp, website, or online store), start and end date, and optional discount code.
   - Can view their active/inactive offers via a dashboard.

3. Admin:
   - Full access to manage users, companies, and offers.
   - Can approve, delete, or suspend any offer.
   - Manage categories and content.
