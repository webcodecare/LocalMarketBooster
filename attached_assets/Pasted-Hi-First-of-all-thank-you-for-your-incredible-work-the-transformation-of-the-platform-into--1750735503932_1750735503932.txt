Hi,

First of all, thank you for your incredible work — the transformation of the platform into “براق” has exceeded expectations. Everything from the branding to the user interaction feels smooth, professional, and ready for launch.

✅ The platform now includes:
	•	Priority offer system with featured tag and homepage placement
	•	Full merchant subscription packages (Basic, Featured, Premium)
	•	Lead generation flow with a “Like” button that collects user details and links them to the merchant
	•	Admin tools for managing all aspects of offers, leads, CMS content, and analytics
	•	Full integration of external tracking tools (GTM, Google Ads, Meta Pixel, TikTok Pixel)

The system feels polished and production-ready.

🔄 Now, let’s move forward to the next strategic stage.

I’d like to begin building the following features to strengthen merchant visibility, user experience, and platform intelligence.

⸻

📌 1. Public Business Profiles with Offer History
	•	Each merchant should have a public-facing profile page
	•	Components to include:
	•	Merchant name, logo, and bio/description
	•	All current live offers (priority shown first)
	•	Archive of completed/expired offers
	•	SEO-friendly URLs like: platform.com/merchant/barak-co

✅ Purpose: Makes the merchant more visible and helps them market their brand directly.

⸻

📌 2. Smart Offer Recommendation Engine
	•	Implement an intelligent recommendation system on:
	•	Homepage
	•	Inside category pages
	•	After viewing a specific offer (e.g. “You might also like…”)
	•	Logic can include:
	•	User behavior (clicked categories, past likes)
	•	Location-based relevance
	•	Trending/high-performing offers

✅ Purpose: Personalizes the browsing experience and increases engagement.

⸻

📌 3. Multi-Language Toggle (Arabic & English)
	•	Add a language switch in the header (ع / En)
	•	When the user switches language:
	•	Texts, layout direction (LTR/RTL), and fonts update accordingly
	•	CMS content should support bilingual fields where applicable
	•	Admin panel can remain default in English unless localization is required

✅ Purpose: Expands usability to a wider audience and looks more premium.

⸻

📌 4. Gamified Merchant Onboarding Wizard
	•	When a new merchant signs up, show an interactive onboarding flow:
	•	Step 1: Add business info
	•	Step 2: Upload first offer
	•	Step 3: Choose subscription plan
	•	Step 4: Learn how to promote & track analytics
	•	Progress bar + success badges make onboarding feel smooth and guided

✅ Purpose: Boosts onboarding completion rate and reduces merchant confusion.

⸻

Let me know what you’d recommend tackling first, or if you want me to provide wireframes, sample UI ideas, or logic flows for any of the above.

Thanks again — you’re building something exceptional here with براق!
