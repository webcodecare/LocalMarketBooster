Hi Reblit,

I hope you're doing well.

I'd like to proceed with several important features for the Baraq platform. Please find the full breakdown below:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Payment Gateway Integration ‚Äì Moyasar
- Integrate **Moyasar** as the primary payment gateway.  
  üìÑ Documentation: http://docs.moyasar.com
- Ensure it's fully functional and ready for live usage.
- Add the ability to **enable/disable** the payment gateway from the **admin dashboard**.
- Let me manage all payment-related settings easily from the admin panel.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Discount Code Management System
I want a full-featured **discount code** system accessible from the admin dashboard. It should include:

- Create / edit / delete discount codes.
- Set the following options for each code:
  - **Discount Type:** Fixed amount or percentage.
  - **Maximum number of uses.**
  - **Minimum order value** required to activate the code.
  - **Start and end dates.**
- View **how many times** each code has been used.
- Enable/disable specific codes at any time.
- All logic should be validated correctly during checkout.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Affiliate / Marketer Tracking System
I want to onboard marketers and track their performance.

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd like it to work:
- Each **marketer** gets a unique **referral link** or code.
- When a customer registers through that link, the system should:
  - Automatically associate the customer with the respective marketer.
- In the **admin panel**, I should be able to see:
  - How many clients each marketer has brought.
  - Optional: Total sales/revenue generated by each marketer.
  - Enable/disable marketer accounts.
- Later we can explore giving marketers access to a **simple dashboard** to view their performance.

If there‚Äôs a better or more scalable way to implement this (like cookie tracking or URL parameters), I‚Äôm open to suggestions.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics & Tracking Tools Integration
Please integrate the following marketing tracking tools into the system:

- **Google Analytics (GA4)**
- **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**
- **Facebook Pixel**
- (Optional) **TikTok Pixel** / **Snapchat Pixel**

‚öôÔ∏è I want to manage these tracking IDs directly from the **admin dashboard**, with a section where I can input or update:
- GA4 Measurement ID
- GTM Container ID
- Facebook Pixel ID
- TikTok / Snap Pixel scripts if needed

This will allow full control over all tracking without needing to touch the code.

Let me know if you need access to any credentials, or if you‚Äôd prefer a sample `.env` structure to organize these settings.

Please also send me an estimated time to complete all these features.

Thanks a lot for your great work, and I look forward to your feedback!

Best regards,
