Hi again! You've done great work so far — thank you. I'd like to now consolidate all current feedback into a single, complete enhancement request that covers both UX/UI improvements and additional platform functionality.

---

🔹 SECTION 1: UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Header Consistency:**
   - Ensure the main header (logo, navigation, "Add Your Offer" button) is consistently visible across all pages, including login/register pages.
   - Remove duplicate logos or buttons appearing multiple times.

2. **Add "Back" Button:**
   - On internal pages (like /auth), add a clear "Back" or "Return to Home" button for better navigation flow.

3. **Search Bar Styling:**
   - Move it below the header.
   - Improve spacing, padding, and visual style (rounded input + search icon/button).

4. **Category Section:**
   - Style each category as a clean card with icons.
   - Add equal padding, centered text, and consistent layout.

5. **RTL Support (Arabic Layout):**
   - All layouts should follow RTL structure:
     - Right-aligned labels, inputs, and headings.
     - Navigation should start from the right.

6. **Typography:**
   - Use a modern Arabic font like “Tajawal” or “Cairo”.
   - Maintain consistent spacing and visual hierarchy.

7. **Section Separation:**
   - Visually separate homepage sections like “Categories”, “Today’s Offers”, and “Latest Offers” using dividers, background shades, or spacing.

8. **Login/Register Page:**
   - Improve tab styling for "Login" and "Create Account".
   - Add header or breadcrumb.
   - Improve input field spacing and alignment.

🔹 SECTION 2: FUNCTIONALITY UPGRADES

1. **Favorite/Save Offer Feature (❤️):**
   - Add a heart/save button to each offer.
   - When clicked, prompt a small form to collect:
     - Full Name
     - Phone Number
     - City

2. **OTP Integration (Future Phase):**
   - For now, store submitted info without verification.
   - But structure the system to allow future OTP verification via Unifonic or similar provider.

3. **Public Business Profile Page:**
   - Each business should have a public page showing:
     - Logo
     - Description
     - Social media links (full URLs)
     - Active offers
     - Branches (locations)

4. **Branch Management:**
   - Businesses should be able to add multiple branches with:
     - Name, city, address, phone (optional), Google Maps link (optional)

5. **Offer Targeting by Branches or Cities:**
   - Allow businesses to choose one or more branches/cities when creating an offer (checkbox style).
   - Optionally: “All branches” or “All of Saudi Arabia”

6. **Featured Offers:**
   - Businesses can mark an offer as featured.
   - Display featured offers at the top with a distinct style.

7. **View Counter:**
   - Show number of views per offer.
   - Display in the business dashboard, and optionally on the public card.

8. **Share Buttons:**
   - Add sharing options on each offer (WhatsApp, Copy link, etc.)

9. **Contact Business:**
   - Add “Contact Business” button on offers.
   - Redirects to WhatsApp or opens a basic contact form.
