I need two updates for the Baraq platform:

------------------------------------
✅ [1] FULL PACKAGE FEATURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
------------------------------------

Please build an enterprise-level, structured feature selection system inside the "Create Package" interface.

📌 Key Requirements:
- Allow toggling ON/OFF specific features per package.
- Features are grouped into logical categories (collapsible or color-coded).
- Support both English & Arabic labels for each feature.
- Preview summary of active features per package.
- JSON structure for storing selected features and custom limits.

📚 Full Feature Set by Category:

👥 Team & Access Control
- Enable Sub-accounts
- Sub-account Limit (numeric)
- Role-based permissions
- Activity log (track user actions)

📢 Content Publishing
- Video Ads
- Image Ads
- Scheduled Publishing
- Pause/Resume Campaigns
- Premium Screen Locations
- Pin to Top
- Offer Limit (numeric)
- Screen Limit (numeric)
- Custom Ad Duration (numeric)

🎨 Creative & Design
- Free Design Support
- Access to Ad Templates
- Request Edits on Ads

📊 Analytics & Insights
- Real-time Reports
- Ad Performance Comparison
- Weekly Report Emails

🛠 Platform Access & Management
- Advanced Dashboard Access
- Page Builder Access (e.g., create About Us page)
- Offer History
- Notification System
- Auto-renewal Option

⚙️ Support & Services
- Priority Support
- Dedicated Account Manager
- WhatsApp Support
- Access to Training Materials

🏷 Branding & Visibility
- Featured Badge
- Marketplace Placement Priority
- Custom Branding (white-label)

🧠 Additional Notes:
- All feature toggles must be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON or database columns).
- Admin can enable/disable features per package with full control.
- Package comparison table will be added later for merchants.

------------------------------------
🔒 [2] TEMPORARILY HIDE “SCREEN ADS” MODULE
------------------------------------

Please temporarily disable or hide the entire “Screen Ads” module and its related UI components from all users **except Admins**.

Requirements:
- Hide any screen management sections from sidebar/menu.
- Hide screen-related pages, buttons, routes, or links from merchants.
- Only Admin accounts should still see and access this module.
- We will reactivate it later when development is complete.

Let me know when both tasks are completed or if you need clarification on data structure or access rules.
